Flx-bindings dependency injection library for Python
====================================================

Overview
--------

Flx-bindings is a light-weight, unobtrusive dependency injection
library for Python.

It provides the ability to map classes to labels via configuration file,
and then dynamically resolve those dependencies at runtime using the label.

Other features include dependency lifecycle management, treating objects
as singletons, on-demand (lazy) instantiation, and prerequsit actions.
